# Who are we?

Mayhem is a new semi-hardcore raiding guild on Living Flame EU (Season of Discovery). We are a bunch of talented raiders who like to have fun when we raid. We raid and and are looking to grow fast. We've currently cleared Naxxramas HM2. 

We are currently operating a private community server. If you have joined the server but can only see the public channels - Please post a message to @Grinwald, @jihgleh @Amarix  and an officer will grant you 'Member' rank. This will allow you to see our chat channels.
